        <p> A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
            arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern
            digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
            known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
            range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that
            includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
            equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer
            to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
            computer network or computer cluster.
