      <h1>Computer Environment</h1>
      <p>
        A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
        arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern
        digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
        known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
        range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that
        includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
        equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer
        to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
        computer network or computer cluster.
